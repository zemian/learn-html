* First Things First: Block Elements Don’t Need 100% Width

What it Really Means
When you give an element a width of 100% in CSS, you’re basically saying “Make
this element’s content area exactly equal to the explicit width of its parent —
but only if its parent has an explicit width.” So, if you have a parent container
that’s 400px wide, a child element given a width of 100% will also be 400px wide,
and will still be subject to margins, paddings, and borders — on top of the 100%
width setting. The image below attempts to illustrate this:
-->

<div style="width: 400px; height: 400px; border: 1px solid green;">
    <div style="width: 100%; height: 100px; border: 1px solid black; margin: 30px;">
        Hello
    </div>
</div>

</body>
</html>
