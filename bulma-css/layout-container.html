<!--
The container class can be used in any context, but mostly as a direct child of either:

    navbar
    hero
    section
    footer

 The containers width for each breakpoint is the result of: $device - (2 * $gap). The $gap variable has a default value of 32px but can be modified.

This is how the container will behave:

    on $desktop it will have a maximum width of 960px.
    on $widescreen it will have a maximum width of 1152px.
    on $fullhd it will have a maximum width of 1344px.

The values 960, 1152 and 1344 have been chosen because they are divisible by both 12 and 16.
