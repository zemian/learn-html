## Learning HTML/CSS/JS (WebAPI)  

This repo is for exploring mostly HTML and CSS. If 
there is JS in there, they are mostly dealing with WebAPI for DOM.
If you want to see more JS example and learnings, see "learn-js" repo
instead.

## Credits

I created most of the learning files in this repo, but I also added some interested demos from other people as well. I usually add comments or separate
readme to give credit where is due.
