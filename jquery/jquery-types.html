     Some jQuery types:
    
     jQuery or $
     A jQuery object contains a collection of Document Object Model (DOM)
     elements that have been created from an HTML string or selected from a
     document. Since jQuery methods often use CSS selectors to match elements
     from a document, the set of elements in a jQuery object is often called a
     set of "matched elements" or "selected elements".
 
     The jQuery object itself behaves much like an array; it has a length property
     and the elements in the object can be accessed by their numeric indices [0]
     to [length-1]. Note that a jQuery object is not actually a Javascript
     Array object, so it does not have all the methods of a true Array object
     such as join().
 
     Most frequently, you will use the jQuery() function to create a jQuery object.
     jQuery() can also be accessed by its familiar single-character alias of $(),
     unless you have called jQuery.noConflict() to disable this option. Many jQuery
     methods return the jQuery object itself, so that method calls can be chained:
 
     In API calls that return jQuery, the value returned will be the original
     jQuery object unless otherwise documented by that API. API methods such as
     .filter() or .not() modify their incoming set and thus return a new jQuery object.
     
     XMLHttpRequest
     Some of jQuery's Ajax functions return the native XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object,
     or pass it as an argument to success/error/complete handlers, so that you can
     do additional processing or monitoring on the request. Note that Ajax functions
     only return or pass an XHR object when an XHR object is actually used in the
     request. For example, JSONP requests and cross-domain GET requests use a script
     element rather than an XHR object.
 
     Although the XHR object is a standard, there are variations in its behavior
     on different browsers. Refer to the WHATWG site and Mozilla Developer
     Network for more information.
     
     jqXHR
     As of jQuery 1.5, the $.ajax() method returns the jqXHR object, which is a superset
     of the XMLHTTPRequest object. For more information, see the jqXHR section
     of the $.ajax entry
 
     Thenable
     Any object that has a then method.
 
     Deferred Object
     As of jQuery 1.5, the Deferred object provides a way to register multiple
     callbacks into self-managed callback queues, invoke callback queues as
     appropriate, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or
     asynchronous function.
 
     Promise Object
     This object provides a subset of the methods of the Deferred object
     (then, done, fail, always, pipe, progress, state and promise) to prevent
     users from changing the state of the Deferred.
 
     Callbacks Object
     A multi-purpose object that provides a powerful way to manage callback
     lists. It supports adding, removing, firing, and disabling callbacks.
     The Callbacks object is created and returned by the $.Callbacks function
     and subsequently returned by most of that function's methods.
