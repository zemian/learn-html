<!--
The with and using bindings create a new binding context, so that descendant
elements are bound in the context of a specified object.

These bindings differ in how they deal with a value of null or undefined:

For the with binding, descendant elements will not be bound at all, but will instead be removed from the document.
For the using binding, it is generally incorrect to supply a null or undefined value since it will try to use that value as the context for descendant elements.
-->

<p>A message should appear after 3 seconds:</p>

<p data-bind="text: helloMessage">Hi</p>

<!--
NOTE: This demo will give error!

Note that we can't use helloMessage properties such as 'greeting' or 'name'
with the "using" binding during initial construction of view, since they
are not defined yet. To resolve this, you need to use "with" binding, or
you need to use "if" binding to guard it first.

    <p data-bind="text: greeting + ' ' + name">Hi2</p>
