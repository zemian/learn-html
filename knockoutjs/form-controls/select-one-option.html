        If options is array of string, then both option's label and value are the same.

            - valueAllowUnset Boolean if set to true, allow model value can not be represented in the select.
                              it will display blank!

            - optionsText: Object's property to display as option label.

        For single select, the selected value is accessed using "value" binding.

        For multi select, the selected value is accessed using "selectedOptions" binding.
