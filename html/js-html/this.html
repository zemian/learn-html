    A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other
    languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.

    In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding).
    It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function
    is called. ES5 introduced the bind() method to set the value of a function's this regardless
    of how it's called, and ES2015 introduced arrow functions which don't provide their own this
    binding (it retains the this value of the enclosing lexical context).

    'this' - A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in nonâ€“strict mode,
    is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.
     */

    // == Global context
    this.objId = Math.random().toString(16);
    console.log("Global this.objId", this.objId);
    console.log("Global window.objId", window.objId);

    // == Inside a function, the value of this depends on how the function is called.

    // Example1:
    //   Since the following code is not in strict mode, and because the value of this is not
    //   set by the call, this will default to the global object, which is window in a browser.
    function f1() {
        return this;
    }

    // In a browser:
    console.log("f1() === window", f1() === window); // true
    console.log("f1() === globalThis", f1() === globalThis); // true

    // In Node:
    //f1() === global; // true

    // Example2:
    // In strict mode, however, if the value of this is not set when entering an execution context,
    // it remains as undefined, as shown in the following example:
    function f2() {
        'use strict'; // see strict mode
        return this;
    }
    console.log("f2() === undefined", f2() === undefined); // true

    // Example3:
    //  To set the value of this to a particular value when calling a function,
    //  use call(), or apply() as in the following examples.

    // An object can be passed as the first argument to call or apply and this will be bound to it.
    let obj = {a: 'Custom'};

    // This property is set on the global object
    let a = 'Global';

    function whatsThis() {
        return this.a;  // The value of this is dependent on how the function is called
    }

    console.log("whatsThis()", whatsThis());          // 'Global'
    console.log("whatsThis.call(obj)", whatsThis.call(obj));  // 'Custom'
    console.log("whatsThis.apply(obj)", whatsThis.apply(obj)); // 'Custom'

    // NOTE: The difference between call() vs apply() is that the later will take arguments
    // as single array parameter.

    // Example4:
    //   ECMAScript 5 introduced Function.prototype.bind(). Calling f.bind(someObject) creates a
    //   new function with the same body and scope as f, but where this occurs in the original
    //   function, in the new function it is permanently bound to the first argument of bind,
    //   regardless of how the function is being used.
    function f() {
        return this.a;
    }

    let g = f.bind({a: 'azerty'});
    console.log(g()); // azerty

    let h = g.bind({a: 'yoo'}); // bind only works once!
    console.log(h()); // azerty

    let o = {a: 37, f: f, g: g, h: h};
    console.log(o.a, o.f(), o.g(), o.h()); // 37,37, azerty, azerty

    // == Arrow Function
    // In arrow functions, this retains the value of the enclosing lexical context's this.
    // In global code, it will be set to the global object:
    let globalObject = this;
    let foo = (() => this);
    console.log("foo() === globalObject", foo() === globalObject); // true

    // Arrow functions created inside other functions: their this remains that of the
    // enclosing lexical context.
    function outfun () {
        this.objId = Math.random().toString(16);
        console.log("outfun: this.objId", this.objId);
        this.innerfunc = () => {
            console.log("innerfunc: this.objId", this.objId);
        };
        innerfunc();
    }
    outfun();

    // == Object Function
    // When a function is called as a method of an object, its this is set to the object the
    // method is called on.
    let o = {
        prop: 37,
        f: function() {
            return this.prop;
        }
    };

    console.log("o.f()", o.f()); // 37

    // Same if we attach function later
    let o = {prop: 37};

    function independent() {
        return this.prop;
    }

    o.f = independent;

    console.log("attach function later: o.f()", o.f()); // 37

    // If we change object, the independent 'this' will also change!
    o.b = {g: independent, prop: 42};
    console.log("Changing object with independent function: o.b.g()", o.b.g()); // 42

    // == Constructor function
    // When a function is used as a constructor (with the new keyword), its this is bound
    // to the new object being constructed.
    function C() {
        this.a = 37;
    }

    let o = new C();
    console.log("Constructor function: o.a". o.a); // 37

    // == Event handler
    // When a function is used as an event handler, its this is set to the element
    // the event fired from (some browsers do not follow this convention for listeners
    // added dynamically with methods other than addEventListener()).
    // When called as a listener, turns the related element blue
    function bluify(e) {
        // Always true
        console.log("event this === e.currentTarget", this === e.currentTarget);
        // true when currentTarget and target are the same object
        console.log("event this === e.target", this === e.target);

        console.log("Updating element: ", this);
        this.style.backgroundColor = '#A5D9F3';
    }
