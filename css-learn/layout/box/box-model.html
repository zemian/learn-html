    All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used
    when talking about design and layout.

    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists
    of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

    Explanation of the different parts:

    Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
    Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
    Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
    Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear

    The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

    We can control the box size with "width" and "height".

    Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS,
    you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the full size
    of an element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.

    Size Calculation:
    300px (width of content)
    + 100px (left + right padding)
    + 30px (left + right border)
    + 40px (left + right margin)
    = 470px

     */

    .box {
        width: 300px;
        height: 300px;
        margin: 20px;
        border: 15px solid green;
        padding: 50px;
    }
