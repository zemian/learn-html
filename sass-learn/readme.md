## What's difference between SCSS vs SASS

    There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS (Sassy CSS) 
    and used throughout this reference, is an extension of the syntax of CSS. 
    This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid SCSS file with the 
    same meaning. This syntax is enhanced with the Sass features described below. 
    Files using this syntax have the .scss extension.

    The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or sometimes just 
    "Sass"), provides a more concise way of writing CSS. It uses indentation 
    rather than brackets to indicate nesting of selectors, and newlines rather 
    than semicolons to separate properties. Files using this syntax have the 
    .sass extension.
