		What is PI:
		 The number π (/paɪ/) is a mathematical constant.
		 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi
		 PI = Circumference / Diamteter

		How to calculate PI digits:
		 https://www.mathscareers.org.uk/article/calculating-pi/
		
		Algorithms:
		 - Using an inverse tangent (arctan) infinite series
		 - New iterative algorithms for computing π, which were much faster than the infinite series
		 - The invention of fast multiplication algorithms that could multiply large numbers very rapidly
		 
		 NOTE: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.
		 
		 - New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms, yet are simpler and less memory intensive
			- Srinivasa Ramanujan
			- Chudnovsky
		 
		 - Spigot algorithms: they produce single digits of π that are not reused after they are calculated.
		 - Simon Plouffe: PSLQ integer relation algorithm
		 - One of Plouffe formula, unlike others before it, can produce any individual hexadecimal digit of π without calculating all the preceding digits.
			
			
		 NOTE: formula are describe to produce number of digits per term.

		// First thousand digits
		// TO calculate a million digit, replace 1020n to 1000020n
        let i = 1n;
        let x = 3n * (10n ** 1020n);
        let pi = x;

            x = x * i / ((i + 1n) * 4n);
            pi += x / (i + 2n);
            i += 2n;
        }
        console.log(pi / (10n ** 20n));
