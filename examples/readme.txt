## html-demos

Some interesting HTML/CSS/JS examples. Many examples are collected from online
by other talented folks, and some are just simple hello world to test out
the libraries.

## zemian-demos

Here I have made some simple HTML/CSS/JS apps.

### todo-list
I wrote a simple "todo-list" application in few different FrontEnd JS libraries.
This simple app will allow you to explore a framework with little more than
just hello world.

The app should let user add a new todo item to a list. Mark an item in list
as done. Or delete an item from list.
