<h1>Mouseover Demo - See Console</h1>
<div id="demo" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: tomato;">
    <p>Mouseover Me!</p>
</div>

<script>
    window.addEventListener('mouseover', function(event) {
        console.log("mouseover event:", event);
    });

    /*
    NOTE: mouseover vs mouseenter:
     mouseover fires when the pointer moves into the child element as well, while mouseenter
     fires only when the pointer moves into the bound element.
     onmousemove : occurs every time the mouse pointer is moved over the div element.
     onmouseenter : only occurs when the mouse pointer enters the div element.

    Common Event attributes:
     Event.target - A reference to the target to which the event was originally dispatched.
        (Event.srcElement non-standard alias to "Event.target")
     Event.isTrusted - Indicates whether or not the event was initiated by the browser or by script.
     Event.timeStamp - The time at which the event was created (in milliseconds).

    CustomEvent.detail - Any custom data application pass to this custom event object.
